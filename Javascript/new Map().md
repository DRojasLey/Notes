The new Map() function will create a map element

Map is similar to an object literal, but the object literal can only have symbols or strings as keys.
The map can use any data type a as key, including:
* objects
* arrays
* strings
* numbers
* symbols
* functions

Example

```
Map(2) {'name' => 'Alice', 123 => 'Bob'}
```

 "Map(2)" refers to the type of data structure: Map 
 (2) is the number of key:value pairs 

- the first key is 'name' and the value is 'Alice'
- the second key is '123' and the value is 'Bob'

### When to use map?

Use a Map when you need to store key-value pairs with any data type for keys, preserve the insertion order, or perform frequent operations like adding, removing, or retrieving elements. 1
