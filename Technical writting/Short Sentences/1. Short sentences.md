As in code reduce the length of the sentences used

Shorting sentences will improve readability and clarity.

Short documentation is easier and faster to maintain

Longer sentences/documentation introduce more points of failure

Each sentence should focus in a single idea.

### Exercise

Convert the following overly long sentence to a series of shorter sentences. Don't revise too much; just end up with a few sentences instead of only one.

### Resolution

> In bash, use the if, then, and fi statements to implement a simple conditional branching block in which the if statement evaluates an expression, the then statement introduces a block of statements to run when the if expression is true, and the fi statement marks the end of the conditional branching block.

In bash, use the if, then and fi statements to implement conditional branching blocks.
The if statement evaluates an expression. The then statement runs a block of statements when the if expression is true.  The fi marks the end of the conditional branching block.
