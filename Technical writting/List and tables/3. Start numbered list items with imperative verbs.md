Consider starting all items in a numbered list with an imperative verb. An **imperative verb** is a command, such as **open** or **start**. For example, notice how all of the items in the following parallel numbered list begin with an imperative verb:

1. Download the Frambus app from Google Play or iTunes.
2. Configure the Frambus app's settings.
3. Start the Frambus app.

The following numbered list is nonparallel because two of the sentences start with an imperative verb, but the third item does not:

1. Instantiate the Froobus class.
2. Invoke the Froobus.Salmonella() method.
3. The process stalls.

### Exercise

Make the following list parallel. Ensure that each element in the result list begins with an imperative verb:

1. Stop Frambus
2. The key configuration file is `/etc/frambus`. Open this file with an ASCII text editor.
3. In this file, you will see a parameter named Carambola, which is currently set to the default value (32). Change this value to 64.
4. When you are finished setting this parameter, save and close the configuration file
5. now, start Frambus again.

### Resolution

1. Stop Frambus.\
2. Open the key configuration file `/etc/frambus`, with an ASCII text editor. 
3. Change the default value of Carambola (32) to 64.
4. Save and close the configuration file.
5. Restart Frambus.
