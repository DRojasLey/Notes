What separates effective lists from defective lists? Effective lists are parallel; defective lists tend to be nonparallel. All items in a **parallel** list look like they "belong" together. That is, all items in a parallel list match along the following parameters:

- Grammar
- Logical category
- Capitalization
- Punctuation

Conversely, at least one item in a **nonparallel** list fails at least one of the preceding consistency checks.

For example, the following list is parallel because all the items are plural nouns (grammar), edible (logical category), in title case (capitalization), and without periods or commas (punctuation).

- Carrots
- Potatoes
- Cabbages

By contrast, the following list is painfully nonparallel along all parameters:

- Carrots
- Potatoes
- The summer light obscures all memories of winter.
### Exercise

1. Is the following list parallel or nonparallel?

- Broccoli inspires feelings of love or hate.
- Potatoes taste delicious.
- Cabbages.

2. Is the following list parallel or nonparallel?

- The red dots represent sick trees.
- Immature trees are represented by the blue dots.
- The green dots represent healthy trees.


### Resolution
1. List is non parallel, first two items are sentences and the last one is not a sentence
2. List is non parallel as the second element has passive voice
