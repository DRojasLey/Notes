Seek opportunities to convert prose into lists.

## Choose the correct type of list

- Bulleted lists
- Numbered lists
- Embedded lists

Use **Bulleted lists** for unordered items, where the meaning will not change, if the meaning changes by altering the order of the items we should use a **numbered list**.

**Embedded lists** are list masked into a sentence, convert embedded list into the other two types of list as much as possible.


### Exercise

Convert the following paragraph into one or more lists:

> Today at work, I have to code three unit tests, write a design document, and review Janet's latest document. After work, I have to wash my car without using any water and then dry it without using any towels.

Don't forget to introduce your list(s).

### Resolution

Today at work I have to:
- Code three unit test
- Write a design document
- Review Janet's latest document

After work:
 1. Wash my car without using any water
 2. Dry the car without using any towels.
